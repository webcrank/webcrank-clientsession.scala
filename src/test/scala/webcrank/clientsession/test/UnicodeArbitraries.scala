   * This character generator is similar to the default one from ScalaCheck, but it filters out:
   * 1. Unprintable control characters.  These cause problems in Mongo queries, and should not able
   *    to get into our database since they will not be present in inputs parsed from HTTP text.
   * 2. Characters that do not exist in the default platform encoding.  We can exclude a big range
   *    of these right away (which ScalaCheck does) because they're in the range used for two-
   *    character UTF-16 sequences, but others are only detected by checking Character.isDefined(_).
   *    The symptom of using a bad character in a string is that when you encode it to UTF-8 and
   *    back again, you get a different string, so any of our web and database tests that check the
   *    input against the output may fail-- and you'll see a question mark somewhere in the data,
   *    since that's how bad characters are displayed.
   * This involves building a humungous list of characters, but it only gets built once, and since
   * it's an array the random strings will be a bit faster than ScalaCheck's usual.
